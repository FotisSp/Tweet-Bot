# Tweet Bot

Simple Twitter bot to get information about data fetched from the twitter stream. The process is long and we needed a way to be sure that the project is running as expected on the remote machine.

Please notice that you have to use different credentials for ChatBot and TweetBot.

### **Usage**:
Add your credentials and then export it as a jar. Then add the jar as external jar to the project build path. Then use it as:

TweetBot bot = new TweetBot();
